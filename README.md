I am currently a Theoretical Particle Physics PhD student at University College London (UCL). My research is working towards enhancing our current knowledge of Parton Distribution Functions, used to analyse data from particle collider experiments.

I also have a strong interest in Machine Learning and have professional experience in applying these techniques to real world data.

  The header image shown in this profile page has been produced by style transfer. I have used a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) to recast one of my favourite photographs (the entire human race, minus Michael Collins) with Van Gogh's "The Starry Night". Check out my `deep_dreams` repo to see the code, and more images!
